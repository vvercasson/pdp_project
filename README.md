Furthermore, to give the community a useful tool that can be used by any clinicians without any knowledge of coding, we set up a ðŸ‘‰[Binder repository](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/vvercasson/pdp_project/HEAD?labpath=jupyter_notebook_generic_content_analysis.ipynb)ðŸ‘ˆ, guiding the reader to run the code in a fully online environemnent. This code does not limit to Sleep content analysis and can be ran on any dataset formatted the following way.


## File formatting
* Excel file, uploaded to binder;
* The three first columns must be respextively:
   * the category of symptoms (put an empty first columns in your file if you do not categorize symptoms)
   * the subcategory of each symptom (empy if no subcategory)
   * the abbreviations that will be plotted on the radial figure
   * the name of the symptoms
* Each columns represent a questionnaire or a reference classification
* Each cell contains either 
   * 0 if the symptoms is not in the questionnaire
   * 1 if the symptoms is *specific* in the questionnaire (i.e. the symptom has been found in an item of the questionnaire referring only to this symptom)
   * 2 if the symptom is *compound* in the questionnaire (i.e. the symptom has been found in an item of the questionnaire referring to at least two symptoms)

## How to use our code

* If you are are familiar with Jupyter Notebooks, just download the notebook and the excel file, and *voila*.

* If you do not even know what a Jupyer Notebook is, please click on ðŸ‘‰[this link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/vvercasson/pdp_project/HEAD?labpath=jupyter_notebook_generic_content_analysis.ipynb)ðŸ‘ˆ, wait a few second for the binder server to launch, and follows the instructions in the notebook.
